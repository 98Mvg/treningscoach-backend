## Visual Mood

- **Dark, athletic, futuristic, pulse-driven**
- Cinematic lighting with dramatic shadows
- Neon purple and cyan as lighting/glow effects, not flat color fills
- Photorealistic quality, not illustrated or cartoonish
- Think: gym at night lit by neon, smartwatch glowing on wrist, person mid-sprint with heart rate overlay
- Shallow depth of field for subject focus
- Slight cinematic grain acceptable for mood

## Subjects

1. **Athletes working out** — Running, lifting, HIIT, functional training. High energy, mid-effort moments.
2. **Smartwatches showing pulse data** — Wrist close-ups, glowing heart rate lines, connected tech aesthetic.
3. **Voice coaching visualization** — Sound waves from earbuds, audio cue representations in cyan.
4. **Gym environments** — Dark, neon-lit, cinematic. Equipment as backdrop, never the focus.
5. **Coach in your pocket** — Phone in hand/pocket/armband with Coachi UI glowing, pushing through a workout. Your AI coach is always with you, driving you harder.
6. **Human effort** — Athlete mid-push with visible determination, coached by an invisible force. Sweat, tension, focus.

## Don'ts

- No cartoons, illustrations, or flat design
- No "breathing app" or meditation imagery (yoga poses, zen gardens, candles)
