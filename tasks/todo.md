# Task Plan (Active)

Updated: 2026-02-23

## Working Rules (from workflow image)

- For non-trivial work, write a short checkable plan before implementation.
- Stop and re-plan if execution goes sideways.
- Verify behavior before marking anything done.
- Keep changes minimal and focused on root cause.
- Update this file with progress and review notes.

## Next Session Plan

- [ ] Validate iPhone runtime after NaN hardening.
- [ ] Confirm mic long-press behavior and workout stop behavior do not conflict.
- [ ] Keep workout UI minimal text and backend diagnostics separated from user-facing UI.
- [ ] Continue Phase 3 sensor work (HR/watch quality handling + fallback clarity).
- [ ] Re-run focused checks and capture results below.

## Progress Log

- 2026-02-23: Resumed with workflow-orchestration rules from user-provided image.

## Review Results
